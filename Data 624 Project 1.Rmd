## **Introduction**

In this project, I will forecast how much cash is taken out of 4 different ATM machines for May 2010. The data is provided in a single file called ATM624Data.xlsx. The variable 'Cash' is provided in hundreds of dollars. I will use time series forecasting techniques to predict the cash withdrawals for May 2010.

I will perform data exploration, data preparation, and model building to forecast the cash withdrawals for May 2010. I will analyze the cash withdrawals, decompose the time series data, and build and evaluate different time series forecasting models to predict the cash withdrawals.

I will compare the performance of different forecasting models, such as ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Prophet, based on their accuracy metrics and select the best model for forecasting cash withdrawals for May 2010.

Finally, I will visualize the forecasts generated by the selected model and save the forecasted values to an Excel-readable file for further analysis and reporting.

## **Project Outline**

1. Load Libraries and Data: I will load the necessary libraries and import the data from the ATM624Data.xlsx file.

2. Data Exploration: I will explore the data to understand its structure, data types, and missing values.

3. Data Preparation: I will prepare the data by converting the DATE column to a date-time object, sorting the data by date, handling missing values, and investigating and potentially removing outliers.

4. Data Aggregation and Initial Analysis by ATM: I will aggregate the data by ATM machine to analyze the cash withdrawals for each ATM separately.

5. Time Series Analysis and Forecasting: I will analyze the Cash variable, decompose the time series data, and perform correlation analysis to understand the patterns and trends in the data. I will build and evaluate different time series forecasting models to predict the cash withdrawals for May 2010.

6. Build and Evaluate Time Series Forecasting Models: I will build and evaluate ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Prophet models to forecast the cash withdrawals for May 2010. I will compare the performance of these models based on their accuracy metrics and select the best model for forecasting cash withdrawals.

7. Forecast Output: I will save the forecasts generated by the selected model for cash withdrawals in May 2010 to an Excel-readable file for further analysis and reporting.

## **Data Exploration**

I will start by loading the data and exploring its structure, data types, and missing values. This will help me understand the data and identify any issues that need to be addressed before proceeding with time series analysis and forecasting.


```{r}
# Load the data
ATM <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enidroman/Data-624-Predictive-Analytics/refs/heads/main/ATM624Data%20(3).csv")
head(ATM) # Display the first few rows of the data
```


The data contains 4 columns: ATM, Date, Cash, and Weekday. The ATM column contains the ATM machine number, the Date column contains the date, the Cash column contains the amount of cash taken out in hundreds of dollars, and the Weekday column contains the day of the week.

### Data Types and Summary

I will now check the structure of the data to see the data types of each column and if there are any missing values.

The summary() function provides data types alongside summary statistics, especially useful for mixed data types.


```{r}
# Check data types
summary(ATM)
```


These methods allow me to confirm that each column has the expected data type and will help me spot any data type mismatches before proceeding with analysis.

DATE is currently a character (chr) column. Since I need it as a date-time object to perform time series analysis, I should convert it to the appropriate date format.

ATM is also a character (chr) column, representing different ATMs. Converting it to a factor might make sense if you want to analyze data by ATM groups.

Cash is an integer (int) column, which is appropriate since it represents numerical cash amounts.

NA Values: There are 19 missing values (NAs) in Cash, which I’ll need to handle. I can fill these in with imputed values, drop them, or analyze why they’re missing (e.g., data entry errors or machine downtime).

Outliers: Cash has a high maximum value (10920) compared to its mean (155.6) and 3rd quartile (114), suggesting potential outliers. I might want to investigate these outliers to see if they represent large, legitimate withdrawals or possible data errors.


To see the overall start and end dates, I use range() on the DATE column. This will give me the first and last dates in the dataset.

### Date Range

I will now check the range of dates in the DATE column to ensure that the data is within the expected time frame and that the dates are in chronological order. This will help me identify any inconsistencies or errors in the date column.


```{r}
# Check the range of dates
range(ATM$DATE, na.rm = TRUE)
```

It appears that the dates are not in chronological order, and the range I received ("1/1/2010 12:00:00 AM" to "9/9/2009 12:00:00 AM") suggests there might be inconsistencies or even incorrect entries in the date column. I will need to sort the data by date and check for any inconsistencies in the date column.

### Visualization of Missing Values

I will now visualize the missing values in the Cash column using the ggplot. This will help me understand the distribution of missing values and decide how to handle them.

This code calculates the count of missing values for each column in the ATM dataset and then creates a bar plot showing these counts. Each bar represents a variable, with its height indicating the number of missing values, helping to quickly identify columns with missing data.


```{r}
# Calculate the number of missing values for each column
missing_counts <- ATM %>%
  summarise(across(everything(), ~ sum(is.na(.)))) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "Variable", values_to = "MissingCount")

# Create a bar plot of missing values
ggplot(missing_counts, aes(x = Variable, y = MissingCount)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") +
  labs(title = "Number of Missing Values per Variable", x = "Variable", y = "Count of Missing Values") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```


From the bar plot in the image, it seems that only the Cash variable has missing values (around 19), while the ATM and DATE columns do not have any missing data. This visualization confirms that missing values are limited to the Cash column, allowing you to focus any data-cleaning efforts on handling these missing values specifically in that column.

### Visualization of Cash Outliers

I will now visualize the distribution of cash withdrawals to identify any potential outliers. Outliers can significantly impact the accuracy of time series forecasting models, so it's important to understand their presence and nature.

I will create a box plot and a histogram of the Cash variable to visualize the distribution of cash withdrawals and identify any potential outliers.


```{r}
# Box Plot for Cash to Visualize Outliers
ggplot(ATM, aes(y = Cash)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "skyblue", outlier.colour = "red", outlier.shape = 16) +
  labs(title = "Box Plot of Cash Withdrawals", y = "Cash (in hundreds of dollars)") +
  theme_minimal()

# Histogram for Cash to Understand Distribution
ggplot(ATM, aes(x = Cash)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Cash Withdrawals", x = "Cash (in hundreds of dollars)", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlim(0, 2000)  # Adjust x-axis limit to focus on lower range and view distribution more clearly
```


The box plot shows a single extreme outlier far above the main cluster of values, around the 10,920 mark. This indicates an unusually large withdrawal, which is far from the typical values.

Most of the data points are clustered near the bottom of the range, suggesting that typical withdrawals are much smaller than this outlier.

The histogram shows that the vast majority of Cash values are concentrated in the lower range, with very few withdrawals at higher values.

The distribution is heavily skewed to the right, with a long tail due to the outlier(s). This skewness can affect the performance of forecasting models, especially those that assume a normal distribution of data.

## **Data Preparation**

Before proceeding with time series forecasting, I will perform the following data preparation steps:

1. Convert the DATE column to a date-time object.
2. Sort the data by date to ensure it is in chronological order.
3. Handle missing values in the Cash column.
4. Investigate and potentially remove outliers in the Cash column.

### Convert DATE to Date-Time Object

I will convert the DATE column to a date-time object using the lubridate package. This will allow me to perform time series analysis and forecasting based on the date-time information.

str() and class() functions are used to confirm that the DATE column has been successfully converted to a date-time object.


```{r}
# Convert DATE to Date-Time Object
ATM$DATE <- as.Date(ATM$DATE, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
str(ATM$DATE) # Check the data type of DATE column
class(ATM$DATE) # Check the class of DATE column
```

Date conversion is successful, and the DATE column is now a date object, allowing for time-based analysis and forecasting.

### Sort Date by Chronological Order

Please note that the dates are not in chronological order, as seen in the range() output earlier.

* I had attempted to do a visualization of the date range before putting the date in order but was unsuccessful do to the quantity of dates that the data have. 

I will sort the data by the DATE column to ensure that the data is in chronological order. This will help me identify any inconsistencies or errors in the date column and ensure that the data is correctly ordered for time series analysis.


```{r}
# Sort Data by chronological order
ATM <- ATM[order(ATM$DATE), ]
head(ATM) # Check if the data is sorted correctly
```


The data is now sorted by date in ascending order, which is essential for time series analysis and forecasting. This step ensures that the data is correctly ordered and ready for further analysis.

With dates formatted correctly, I can then focus on missing values. For example, if I find missing values in Cash but the DATE column is complete, I might infer that the Cash values are missing due to data collection issues rather than gaps in time.

Proper date formatting also makes it easier to decide on imputation strategies, like filling in missing values based on patterns by day, week, or month.

### Check for Missing Dates

I will group the data by year and month, then count the number of records in each month. This will allow you to see if any months are missing or if there’s sparse data in certain periods, especially in April and May.


```{r}
ATM %>%
  mutate(year = lubridate::year(DATE), month = lubridate::month(DATE, label = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(year, month) %>%
  summarise(record_count = n()) %>%
  arrange(year, month)
```


The data appears to have records for each month from January to September, with varying numbers of records in each month. This suggests that the data is not missing any months, and there are no gaps in the time series.

### Filter Data for April and May

I will now filter the data for the months of April and May to focus on the period for which I need to forecast cash withdrawals. This will allow me to work with a smaller subset of the data and focus on the relevant time frame for forecasting.


```{r}
# Filter Data for April and May
ATM_April_May <- ATM %>%
  filter(DATE >= "2010-04-01" & DATE <= "2010-05-31")
head(ATM_April_May) # Display the first few rows of the filtered data
```


### Visualize Cash Withdrawals for April and May

I will now visualize the cash withdrawals for the months of April and May to understand the patterns and trends in the data. This will help me identify any seasonality, trends, or other patterns that may be present in the cash withdrawals.


```{r}
# Line Plot of Cash Withdrawals for April and May
ggplot(ATM_April_May, aes(x = DATE, y = Cash, group = ATM, color = ATM)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Cash Withdrawals for April and May 2010", x = "Date", y = "Cash (in hundreds of dollars)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

The line plot shows the cash withdrawals for the months of April and May 2010 for each ATM machine. The plot allows me to visualize the patterns and trends in cash withdrawals over time and identify any seasonality or other patterns that may be present in the data.

### Handle Missing Values

Please note that the missing values in the Cash column are not due to missing dates, as the DATE column does not contain any missing values. This suggests that the missing Cash values are due to other reasons, such as data entry errors or machine downtime.

I will now handle the missing values in the Cash column. There are several ways to deal with missing data, including imputation, deletion, or modeling the missingness. I will impute missing values using the mean of the Cash column.

summary() and sapply() functions are used to check if the missing values have been imputed successfully and if there are any missing values left in the dataset.


```{r}
# Impute Missing Values in Cash
ATM$Cash[is.na(ATM$Cash)] <- mean(ATM$Cash, na.rm = TRUE) 
summary(ATM) # Check if missing values have been imputed 
sapply(ATM, function(x) sum(is.na(x))) # Check if there are any missing values left

```

The missing values in the Cash column have been successfully imputed using the mean of the Cash column. There are no missing values left in the dataset, as confirmed by the summary() and sapply() functions.

Imputing missing values allows me to retain all the data points for analysis and forecasting, ensuring that the time series model is built on complete data.


### Investigate the Cash Outliers

I will now investigate the extreme outlier in the Cash column to determine if it is a legitimate data point or an error. Outliers can significantly impact the accuracy of time series forecasting models, so it is essential to understand their nature and decide how to handle them.

I will identify the extreme outlier(s) in the Cash column and decide whether to keep or remove them based on their validity and impact on the analysis.

The boxplot.stats() function is used to identify the outliers in the Cash column, and the results are displayed to understand the nature of the outliers.


```{r}
# Identify Outliers in Cash
outliers <- boxplot.stats(ATM$Cash)$out
outliers
```

The boxplot.stats() function identifies the extreme outlier in the Cash column, which has a value of 10920. This outlier is significantly higher than the other values in the dataset and may impact the accuracy of the time series forecasting model.

I will now decide whether to keep or remove this outlier based on its validity and impact on the analysis. If the outlier is a legitimate data point, I may choose to keep it in the dataset. However, if it is an error or an anomaly, I may decide to remove it to prevent it from affecting the forecasting model.

### Remove Outliers

I will now remove the extreme outlier from the Cash column to prevent it from affecting the time series forecasting model. Removing outliers can improve the accuracy of the model by reducing the impact of extreme values on the forecast.

I will remove the outlier identified earlier (10920) from the dataset and confirm that it has been successfully removed.


```{r}
# Remove Outliers from Cash
ATM <- ATM[ATM$Cash != 10920, ]
summary(ATM) # Check if the outlier has been removed
```

The extreme outlier (10920) has been successfully removed from the Cash column, as confirmed by the summary() function. The dataset is now free of extreme outliers, which will help improve the accuracy of the time series forecasting model.

## **Data Aggregation and Initial Analysis by ATM**

I will now aggregate the data by ATM machine to analyze the cash withdrawals for each ATM separately. This will allow me to understand the patterns and trends in cash withdrawals for each ATM and identify any differences between them.


```{r}
# Aggregate Data by ATM
ATM_Agg <- ATM %>%
  group_by(ATM) %>%
  summarise(total_cash = sum(Cash), avg_cash = mean(Cash), max_cash = max(Cash), min_cash = min(Cash))
ATM_Agg
```

The aggregated data shows the total cash withdrawals, average cash withdrawals, maximum cash withdrawals, and minimum cash withdrawals for each ATM machine. This analysis provides insights into the cash withdrawal patterns for each ATM and helps identify any differences between them.

## **Time Series Analysis and Forcasting**

### Cash Variable Analysis

I will now analyze the Cash variable to understand its distribution, trends, and seasonality. This analysis will help me identify any patterns in the cash withdrawals and guide the selection of appropriate time series forecasting models.

I will create a time series plot of the Cash variable to visualize the cash withdrawals over time and identify any trends or seasonality in the data.


```{r}
# Create Time Series Plot of Cash Withdrawals
ATM_TS <- ATM %>%
  group_by(DATE) %>%
  summarise(total_cash = sum(Cash))
# Create Time Series Plot of Cash Withdrawals
ggplot(ATM_TS, aes(x = DATE, y = total_cash)) +
  geom_line(color = "skyblue") +
  labs(title = "Time Series Plot of Cash Withdrawals", x = "Date", y = "Total Cash Withdrawals") +
  theme_minimal()

```

The time series plot shows the total cash withdrawals over time, allowing me to visualize the patterns and trends in the data. The plot helps me identify any seasonality, trends, or other patterns in the cash withdrawals, which will guide the selection of appropriate forecasting models.

## **Time Series Decomposition**

### Analyze the Trend, Seasonality, and Residual Components

I will now decompose the time series data to identify the trend, seasonality, and residual components. Decomposing the time series helps separate the different components of the data and understand their individual contributions to the overall pattern.

I will use the decompose() function to decompose the time series data and visualize the trend, seasonality, and residual components.


```{r}
# Decompose Time Series Data
ATM_TS_decomp <- decompose(ts(ATM_TS$total_cash, frequency = 7))
# Plot Decomposition
autoplot(ATM_TS_decomp) +
  labs(title = "Decomposition of Time Series Data", x = "Date", y = "Total Cash Withdrawals") +
  theme_minimal()
```

The decomposition plot shows the trend, seasonality, and residual components of the time series data. The trend component represents the long-term movement in the data, the seasonality component represents the periodic fluctuations, and the residual component represents the random fluctuations in the data.

Understanding the individual components of the time series data will help me select appropriate forecasting models and make accurate predictions.

This is the original time series of cash withdrawals, showing high-frequency fluctuations and some overall trends.

The trend component captures the general upward or downward direction over time. In your plot, there seems to be variability, with periods of increased withdrawals followed by declines. This can indicate changes in demand over time.

The seasonal component shows regular, repeating patterns, which in this case appear as weekly cycles (due to frequency = 7). This indicates that cash withdrawals follow a weekly pattern, with certain days of the week potentially seeing higher withdrawals.

The residual component captures the random fluctuations that are not explained by the trend or seasonality. This component is essential for capturing unexpected changes or noise in the data.

### Correlation Analysis

I will now perform a correlation analysis to identify any relationships between the cash withdrawals and the date. This analysis will help me understand the strength and direction of the relationship between the variables and guide the selection of appropriate forecasting models.

I will calculate the correlation coefficient between the DATE and total_cash variables to measure the strength of the relationship between the date and cash withdrawals.


```{r}
# Calculate Correlation Coefficient
cor(ATM_TS$total_cash, as.numeric(ATM_TS$DATE))
```

The correlation coefficient between the DATE and total_cash variables is -0.02, indicating a weak negative relationship between the date and cash withdrawals. This suggests that the date does not have a significant impact on cash withdrawals, and other factors may be driving the patterns in the data.

The correlation coefficient is close to zero, indicating a weak relationship between the date and cash withdrawals.This means that as time progresses, there is a very slight decrease in total cash withdrawals, but the relationship is not strong enough to be considered significant or predictive.

The low correlation suggests that cash withdrawals do not have a strong linear trend over time in this data. This aligns with the decomposition analysis where we observed variability in the trend component but no clear, strong upward or downward direction.

If there were a significant time-based trend (e.g., a steady increase or decrease in withdrawals), you would expect a higher positive or negative correlation.

Since seasonality (like weekly patterns) doesn’t affect this linear correlation with date, a low correlation does not negate the presence of strong seasonal patterns.

You may still see recurring patterns (like increased activity on specific days of the week) without a clear time-based trend.

The weak negative correlation with date suggests no significant time-based trend, but seasonal and random fluctuations are present. For forecasting, focusing on seasonal models rather than time-based trend models would likely be more effective for predicting future cash withdrawals.


So far I organized and aggregated the data to daily totals, converted the Cash values to a useful scale, and ensured dates were formatted correctly. I also checked for missing values and outliers, which can affect the accuracy of time series forecasting models.

I then visualized the cash withdrawals for April and May 2010 to understand the patterns and trends in the data. I also decomposed the time series data to identify the trend, seasonality, and residual components, which will guide the selection of appropriate forecasting models.

I performed a correlation analysis to identify any relationships between the cash withdrawals and the date. The weak negative correlation suggests that the date does not have a significant impact on cash withdrawals, and other factors may be driving the patterns in the data.

Next, I will build and evaluate different time series forecasting models to predict the cash withdrawals for May 2010. I will use models like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Prophet to compare their performance and select the best model for forecasting cash withdrawals.

## **Build and Evaluate Time Series Forecasting Models**

I will now build and evaluate different time series forecasting models to predict the cash withdrawals for May 2010. I will use models like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Prophet to compare their performance and select the best model for forecasting cash withdrawals.

## **Time Series Forecasting**

I will start by splitting the data into training and testing sets. I will use the data from January 2010 to April 2010 as the training set and the data from May 2010 as the testing set. This will allow me to train the models on historical data and evaluate their performance on unseen data.

I will then build and evaluate the following time series forecasting models:

ARIMA, ETS, and Prophet are commonly used for time series forecasting:

1. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) - 

Purpose: ARIMA captures both trends and seasonal patterns by extending the ARIMA model with seasonal components.

Strengths: Works well with data that exhibits strong, recurring seasonal patterns, such as weekly or monthly cycles.

Best For: Time series with stable seasonality and no abrupt structural changes.

Arima is a popular time series forecasting model that captures the autocorrelation and seasonality in the data. I will use the auto.arima() function from the forecast package to automatically select the best ARIMA model based on the AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) value. I will then use the forecast() function to generate the cash withdrawal forecasts for May 2010. I will compare the performance of the ARIMA model based on its accuracy metrics and select the best model for forecasting cash withdrawals for May 2010. I will compare the performance of the ARIMA model based on its accuracy metrics and select the best model for forecasting cash withdrawals for May 2010. 

2. Exponential Smoothing - 

Purpose: ETS decomposes the series into Error, Trend, and Seasonal components, automatically selecting the best model type (e.g., additive or multiplicative).

Strengths: Flexibility in handling both additive and multiplicative seasonality, making it suitable for data with varying trend and seasonal patterns.

Best For: Time series with a mix of trend and seasonal changes, especially when seasonal effects are non-linear.

I will use the ets() function from the forecast package to fit an Exponential Smoothing model to the training data. I will then use the forecast() function to generate the cash withdrawal forecasts for May 2010. I will compare the performance of the Exponential Smoothing model based on its accuracy metrics and select the best model for forecasting cash withdrawals for May 2010. I will compare the performance of the Exponential Smoothing model based on its accuracy metrics and select the best model for forecasting cash withdrawals for May 2010. 

3. Prophet - 

Purpose: Prophet models time series with both daily and weekly seasonality, handling holidays and irregular events well.

Strengths: Robust against missing data and outliers; adaptable to multiple seasonalities (e.g., daily and weekly) and growth patterns.

Best For: Time series with complex seasonal patterns and occasional anomalies, often used for business and economic data.

I will use Prophet, a robust time series forecasting model developed by Facebook, to forecast the cash withdrawals for May 2010. I will prepare the data for Prophet, fit the model to the training data, and generate the cash withdrawal forecasts for May 2010. 

I will compare the performance of these models based on their accuracy metrics and select the best model for forecasting cash withdrawals for May 2010.

### Split Data into Training and Testing Sets

I will split the data into training and testing sets to train the models on historical data and evaluate their performance on unseen data. I will use the data from January 2010 to April 2010 as the training set and the data from May 2010 as the testing set. Using January 2010 to April 2010 as the training set and May 2010 as the testing set provides a clear division, allowing you to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data for the target forecast period.

This code splits the data into training and testing sets based on the date column. The training set includes data from January 2010 to April 2010, while the testing set includes data from May 2010.

```{r}
# Split Data into Training and Testing Sets
train <- ATM_TS %>%
  filter(DATE >= "2010-01-01" & DATE <= "2010-04-30") %>%
  select(DATE, total_cash)
test <- ATM_TS %>%
  filter(DATE >= "2010-05-01" & DATE <= "2010-05-31") %>%
  select(DATE, total_cash)
```


### ARIMA Model

I will now build an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model to forecast the cash withdrawals for May 2010. ARIMA is a popular time series forecasting model that captures the autocorrelation and seasonality in the data.

I will use the auto.arima() function from the forecast package to automatically select the best ARIMA model based on the AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) value. I will then use the forecast() function to generate the cash withdrawal forecasts for May 2010.

```{r}
# Build ARIMA Model
arima_model <- auto.arima(train$total_cash)
arima_forecast <- forecast(arima_model, h = 31) # Forecast for May 2010 (31 days)
arima_forecast
```

The ARIMA model has generated forecasts for the cash withdrawals for May 2010. The forecast object contains the point forecasts, prediction intervals, and other information about the forecasted values.

Point Forecast:

The central forecasted value for each day. This is the model's best estimate of the cash withdrawal amount (or whatever metric you are forecasting) for each time period.
Lo 80 and Hi 80:

These represent the 80% prediction interval. There’s an 80% probability that the actual value will fall within this range.
Lo 80: The lower bound of the 80% confidence interval.
Hi 80: The upper bound of the 80% confidence interval.
Lo 95 and Hi 95:

These are the 95% prediction intervals, which give a wider range with a 95% probability of containing the actual value.
Lo 95: The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval.
Hi 95: The upper bound of the 95% confidence interval.

For example, on row 121:

Point Forecast: 576.76 (the expected value for that day).
Lo 80 and Hi 80: 98.89 to 1054.63, indicating an 80% probability that the actual value will fall within this range.
Lo 95 and Hi 95: -154.08 to 1307.60, indicating a 95% probability that the actual value will fall within this wider range.

The forecast seems consistent across days, with the Point Forecast remaining the same (576.76) and the confidence intervals also staying consistent across all 31 days. This may suggest that the model expects stable, consistent values each day, or that there is minimal trend or seasonality influencing the forecast during this period.


### Visualization of ARIMA Forecast

I will now visualize the forecasts generated by the ARIMA model to compare the predicted cash withdrawals for May 2010 with the actual values. This will help me evaluate the performance of the ARIMA model and understand how well it captures the patterns in the data.

# Visualize ARIMA Forecast
arima_plot <- autoplot(arima_forecast) +
  labs(title = "ARIMA Forecast for Cash Withdrawals in May 2010", x = "Date", y = "Total Cash Withdrawals") +
  theme_minimal()
arima_plot
```

The forecast plot shows the predicted cash withdrawals for May 2010 generated by the ARIMA model. The plot allows me to compare the forecasted values with the actual cash withdrawals and evaluate the performance of the ARIMA model visually.

Historical Data (Black Line):

The left portion of the plot, shown in black, represents the actual historical cash withdrawal data. This portion provides context, showing past fluctuations and patterns leading up to the forecasted period.

Forecasted Values (Blue Line and Shaded Area):

The blue line represents the point forecast for each day in May 2010, which is the model’s best estimate of daily cash withdrawals based on the ARIMA model.

The shaded area around the blue line indicates confidence intervals:

The darker blue band likely represents the 80% confidence interval, suggesting an 80% probability that the actual cash withdrawals will fall within this range.

The lighter blue band represents the 95% confidence interval, providing a wider range that accounts for greater uncertainty in the forecast.

Uncertainty in Forecast:

The shaded confidence intervals widen as the forecast moves further into the future, reflecting increased uncertainty. This is typical in time series forecasting, as models become less certain the further out they predict.

Steady Forecast:

The forecasted values seem fairly steady, suggesting that the ARIMA model expects cash withdrawals to maintain a similar level throughout May. This could be due to the model finding limited strong seasonal or trend effects in the historical data.

Potential Adjustments:

If you were expecting more pronounced seasonality (e.g., weekly patterns), you might consider a SARIMA model with a seasonal component or an alternative model like Prophet, which can capture more complex seasonality.


### Exponential Smoothing Model

I will now build an Exponential Smoothing model to forecast the cash withdrawals for May 2010. Exponential Smoothing is a simple and effective time series forecasting method that assigns exponentially decreasing weights to past observations.

I will use the ets() function from the forecast package to fit an Exponential Smoothing model to the training data. I will then use the forecast() function to generate the cash withdrawal forecasts for May 2010.

```{r}
# Build Exponential Smoothing Model
es_model <- ets(train$total_cash)
es_forecast <- forecast(es_model, h = 31) # Forecast for May 2010 (31 days)
es_forecast
```


The Exponential Smoothing model has generated forecasts for the cash withdrawals for May 2010. The forecast object contains the point forecasts, prediction intervals, and other information about the forecasted values.

Point Forecast:

This is the central forecasted value for each day, representing the model's best estimate for cash withdrawals (or another target variable) on that specific day.

Lo 80 and Hi 80:

These represent the 80% confidence interval. There's an 80% probability that the actual value will fall within this range.
Lo 80: The lower bound of the 80% confidence interval.
Hi 80: The upper bound of the 80% confidence interval.

Lo 95 and Hi 95:

These represent the 95% confidence interval, which is a wider range indicating a higher degree of certainty.
Lo 95: The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval.
Hi 95: The upper bound of the 95% confidence interval.

Consistent Forecast:

The Point Forecast is the same (576.732) across all rows, which might indicate the model expects stable values over the forecast period. This could be due to the absence of strong seasonality or trend in the model’s output.

The confidence intervals are also fairly consistent across days, suggesting that the model anticipates relatively stable cash withdrawals each day.

Negative Lower Bound:

The Lo 95 column has negative values for some days. This usually suggests a model's high uncertainty about low values. In practice, negative cash withdrawal values are nonsensical, so these could be interpreted as zero for reporting purposes.

### Visualization of Exponential Smoothing Forecast

I will now visualize the forecasts generated by the Exponential Smoothing model to compare the predicted cash withdrawals for May 2010 with the actual values. This will help me evaluate the performance of the Exponential Smoothing model and understand how well it captures the patterns in the data.

```{r}
# Visualize Exponential Smoothing Forecast
es_plot <- autoplot(es_forecast) +
  labs(title = "Exponential Smoothing Forecast for Cash Withdrawals in May 2010", x = "Date", y = "Total Cash Withdrawals") +
  theme_minimal()
es_plot
```

The forecast plot shows the predicted cash withdrawals for May 2010 generated by the Exponential Smoothing model. The plot allows me to compare the forecasted values with the actual cash withdrawals and evaluate the performance of the Exponential Smoothing model visually.

Historical Data (Black Line):

The left portion of the plot, shown in black, represents the actual historical cash withdrawal data. This portion provides context, showing past fluctuations and patterns leading up to the forecasted period.

Forecasted Values (Blue Line and Shaded Area):

The blue line represents the point forecast for each day in May 2010, which is the model’s best estimate of daily cash withdrawals based on the Exponential Smoothing model.

The shaded area around the blue line indicates confidence intervals:

The darker blue band likely represents the 80% confidence interval, suggesting an 80% probability that the actual cash withdrawals will fall within this range.

The lighter blue band represents the 95% confidence interval, providing a wider range that accounts for greater uncertainty in the forecast.

Uncertainty in Forecast:

The shaded confidence intervals widen as the forecast moves further into the future, reflecting increased uncertainty. This is typical in time series forecasting, as models become less certain the further out they predict.

Steady Forecast:

The forecasted values seem fairly steady, suggesting that the Exponential Smoothing model expects cash withdrawals to maintain a similar level throughout May. This could be due to the model finding limited strong seasonal or trend effects in the historical data.

Potential Adjustments:

If you were expecting more pronounced seasonality (e.g., weekly patterns), you might consider a seasonal model like Prophet, which can capture more complex seasonal patterns.


### Prophet Model

I will now build a Prophet model to forecast the cash withdrawals for May 2010. Prophet is a robust time series forecasting model developed by Facebook that can handle missing values, outliers, and seasonal patterns.

I will use the prophet() function from the prophet package to fit a Prophet model to the training data. I will then use the predict() function to generate the cash withdrawal forecasts for May 2010.


```{r}
# Build Prophet Model
# Prepare Data for Prophet
prophet_data <- data.frame(ds = train$DATE, y = train$total_cash)
# Fit Prophet Model
prophet_model <- prophet(prophet_data)
# Generate Forecasts
future <- make_future_dataframe(prophet_model, periods = 31)
prophet_forecast <- predict(prophet_model, future)
# Extract the forecasted values for May 2010
prophet_forecast_may <- prophet_forecast %>%
  filter(ds >= "2010-05-01" & ds <= "2010-05-31") %>%
  select(ds, yhat)  # 'yhat' is the forecasted value in Prophet
prophet_forecast
```

The Prophet model has generated forecasts for the cash withdrawals for May 2010. The forecast object contains the point forecasts, prediction intervals, and other information about the forecasted values.

ds (Date):

This is the date column in POSIXct format, which represents each day in the time series. The values are listed from January 1, 2010, and continue sequentially.
trend:

This column represents the trend component of the forecast, showing the long-term movement in the data over time.
A steadily decreasing trend value, as observed here, suggests a gradual downward trend in cash withdrawals over this period.
additive_terms:

This is the seasonal component or other additional effects that the model adds to the trend for each day.
In Prophet, these could represent weekly or yearly seasonality, capturing patterns that repeat at regular intervals.
additive_terms_lower and additive_terms_upper:

These represent the confidence intervals for the additive terms (e.g., seasonality). They provide an upper and lower bound, indicating the model’s certainty around the additive terms.

Here, the bounds appear constant, suggesting that the model assumes consistent seasonal effects without much variation in this period.

Seasonal Patterns:

The additive_terms values vary significantly across days, with positive and negative values, suggesting a weekly or other cyclic pattern. For example, certain days (like January 1 and January 8) have higher positive values, while other days (like January 5 and January 12) show larger negative values.

This pattern implies that cash withdrawals are higher on some days and lower on others, consistent with weekday-weekend or intra-week patterns often observed in financial data.

Trend Decline:

The trend column shows a steady decrease, indicating a slow decline in overall cash withdrawal values over this period.


Interpretation Example
For a row like 2010-01-01:

Trend: 630.02 — The model estimates that the underlying trend component is around 630.

Additive Terms: 163.50 — The seasonal effect or additive adjustment for this day is positive, suggesting higher activity on this day.

Lower and Upper Bounds: Both are 163.50, indicating the model has high confidence in this seasonal effect.

The forecasted value (yhat) is the sum of the trend and additive terms, representing the model’s best estimate of cash withdrawals for that day.

### Visualization Prophet Forecast

I will now visualize the forecasts generated by the Prophet model to compare the predicted cash withdrawals for May 2010 with the actual values. This will help me evaluate the performance of the Prophet model and understand how well it captures the patterns in the data.

```{r}
# Visualize Prophet Forecast
prophet_model %>%
  plot(prophet_forecast, xlabel = "Date", ylabel = "Total Cash Withdrawals") +
  ggtitle("Prophet Forecast for Cash Withdrawals in May 2010") +
  theme_minimal()
```

The forecast plot shows the predicted cash withdrawals for May 2010 generated by the Prophet model. The plot allows me to compare the forecasted values with the actual cash withdrawals and evaluate the performance of the Prophet model visually.

Historical Data (Black Line):

The left portion of the plot, shown in black, represents the actual historical cash withdrawal data. This portion provides context, showing past fluctuations and patterns leading up to the forecasted period.

Forecasted Values (Blue Line and Shaded Area):

The blue line represents the point forecast for each day in May 2010, which is the model’s best estimate of daily cash withdrawals based on the Prophet model.

The shaded area around the blue line indicates confidence intervals:

The darker blue band likely represents the 80% confidence interval, suggesting an 80% probability that the actual cash withdrawals will fall within this range.

The lighter blue band represents the 95% confidence interval, providing a wider range that accounts for greater uncertainty in the forecast.

Uncertainty in Forecast:

The shaded confidence intervals widen as the forecast moves further into the future, reflecting increased uncertainty. This is typical in time series forecasting, as models become less certain the further out they predict.

Seasonal Patterns:

The forecasted values capture the weekly patterns in cash withdrawals, with higher values on certain days and lower values on others. This suggests that the Prophet model has successfully captured the seasonal effects in the data.

Overall, the Prophet model provides a detailed forecast with point estimates and confidence intervals, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of the forecasted cash withdrawals for May 2010.

Trend shows a steady decrease, indicating a gradual decline in cash withdrawals. Additive Terms show cyclical patterns, likely reflecting weekly seasonality or other periodic effects.The overall forecast combines these components, adding the seasonal variations to the trend for each date.


## **Model Evaluation**

I will now evaluate the performance of the ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Prophet models based on their accuracy metrics. I will compare the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of the models to select the best model for forecasting cash withdrawals for May 2010.

I will calculate the accuracy metrics for each model and compare their performance to determine the most accurate forecasting model.

```{r}
# Calculate Accuracy Metrics for ARIMA Model
arima_accuracy <- accuracy(arima_forecast, test$total_cash)
arima_accuracy
```

```{r}
# Calculate Accuracy Metrics for Exponential Smoothing Model
es_accuracy <- accuracy(es_forecast, test$total_cash)
es_accuracy
```

```{r}
# Calculate Accuracy Metrics for Prophet Model
# Ensure the forecasted and actual values are aligned
actual_values <- test$total_cash
forecasted_values <- prophet_forecast_may$yhat
# Calculate MAE, MSE, and RMSE
mae <- mean(abs(actual_values - forecasted_values))
mse <- mean((actual_values - forecasted_values)^2)
rmse <- sqrt(mse)
# Display the accuracy metrics
accuracy_metrics <- data.frame(MAE = mae, MSE = mse, RMSE = rmse)
accuracy_metrics
```

The accuracy metrics for the ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Prophet models provide insights into the performance of each model in forecasting cash withdrawals for May 2010. The accuracy metrics help evaluate the models based on their ability to predict the actual cash withdrawals accurately.

## **Model Comparison**

I will now compare the performance of the ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Prophet models based on their accuracy metrics. I will select the best model for forecasting cash withdrawals for May 2010 based on the accuracy metrics and overall performance.

```{r}
# Model Comparison
model_comparison <- data.frame(Model = c("ARIMA", "Exponential Smoothing", "Prophet"),
                                MAE = c(arima_accuracy[2], es_accuracy[2], mae),
                                MSE = c(arima_accuracy[3], es_accuracy[3], mse),
                                RMSE = c(arima_accuracy[4], es_accuracy[4], rmse))
model_comparison
```


The model comparison table shows the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for the ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Prophet models. Based on RMSE and MAE values, Prophet appears to be the best-performing model among the three, likely due to its ability to handle complex seasonal components more flexibly. However, the high error rates across all models suggest that the data may have significant variability or unexpected patterns that are difficult for any model to predict accurately.

### Forecast Visualization

I will now visualize the forecasts generated by the ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Prophet models to compare their predictions for cash withdrawals in May 2010. This will help me understand the differences between the models and evaluate their performance visually.

```{r}
# Visualize Forecasts
# ARIMA Forecast Plot
arima_plot <- autoplot(arima_forecast) +
  labs(title = "ARIMA Forecast for Cash Withdrawals in May 2010", x = "Date", y = "Total Cash Withdrawals") +
  theme_minimal()
# Exponential Smoothing Forecast Plot
es_plot <- autoplot(es_forecast) +
  labs(title = "Exponential Smoothing Forecast for Cash Withdrawals in May 2010", x = "Date", y = "Total Cash Withdrawals") +
  theme_minimal()
# Prophet Forecast Plot
prophet_plot <- prophet_model %>%
  plot(prophet_forecast, xlabel = "Date", ylabel = "Total Cash Withdrawals") +
  ggtitle("Prophet Forecast for Cash Withdrawals in May 2010") +
  theme_minimal()
# Combine Plots
gridExtra::grid.arrange(arima_plot, es_plot, prophet_plot, nrow = 3)

```

The forecast visualization shows the predictions generated by the ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Prophet models for cash withdrawals in May 2010. The plots allow me to compare the forecasts from each model visually and evaluate their performance based on the accuracy metrics and overall fit to the data.

ARIMA Forecast

The ARIMA model shows a relatively high degree of variability in the forecasted values, with the confidence intervals expanding towards the forecast period. This suggests that the model is less certain about the cash withdrawals in May 2010, reflecting the uncertainty in the data.

The forecast pattern is relatively smooth, but it lacks any specific indication of seasonality or periodic behavior, suggesting that the ARIMA model focuses on capturing general trends without seasonal adjustments.

The confidence intervals are wide, reflecting uncertainty in the forecast. This could be due to the model's limited ability to capture complex seasonal patterns or unexpected fluctuations in the data.

Exponential Smoothing (ETS) Forecast

The ETS model provides a forecast that looks similar to ARIMA, showing a general trend but no strong seasonal component.

Like ARIMA, it has wide confidence intervals in the forecast period, indicating substantial uncertainty.

The model's focus on smoothing past values could lead to a smoother forecast but may miss capturing any specific seasonality.

Prophet Forecast

The Prophet model’s forecast includes clear seasonality, visible in the periodic oscillations in the forecasted values.

The confidence intervals appear more consistent and slightly narrower than ARIMA and ETS, which suggests that Prophet is more confident in its predictions by accounting for regular patterns in the data.

Prophet’s forecast is based on more complex seasonal and trend components, which can be seen in the periodic structure extending through May.

The model captures the weekly patterns in cash withdrawals, showing higher values on certain days and lower values on others, reflecting the cyclic nature of the data.

The forecast visualization allows me to compare the predictions generated by the ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Prophet models visually and evaluate their performance based on the fit to the data.

ARIMA and ETS: Both models capture a general trend but lack seasonality, and their confidence intervals are quite wide, indicating a high degree of uncertainty.

Prophet: This model captures seasonality more effectively, making it a better fit if cash withdrawals exhibit weekly or monthly patterns. Its confidence intervals are narrower, indicating more reliable predictions.

Given the visuals and the presence of seasonality in the Prophet model, Prophet seems to be the most suitable model for forecasting cash withdrawals in May 2010. Its structure, which can accommodate seasonality, aligns better with the observed data patterns.

## **Forecast Output**

I will generate the forecast output for May 2010 based on the Prophet Forcast model, which was identified as the most accurate model for predicting residential power usage. The forecast output will include the actual values, forecasted values, and the date range for 2014.


```{r}
# Display the forecast output for May 2010
prophet_forecast_may
```

The forecast output for May 2010 provides the forecasted cash withdrawals for each day in May 2010. The output includes the date (ds) and the forecasted value (yhat) for each day, allowing stakeholders to understand the predicted cash withdrawals for the target period.

The forecasted values can be used for planning, resource allocation, and decision-making based on the expected cash withdrawals for May 2010.

### Visualization of May 2010 Forecast

I will now visualize the forecasted cash withdrawals for May 2010 generated by the Prophet model. This visualization will provide a clear overview of the forecasted values and help stakeholders understand the predicted cash withdrawals for each day in May 2010.

```{r}
# Visualize Prophet Forecast for May 2010

  plot(prophet_forecast, xlabel = "Date", ylabel = "Total Cash Withdrawals") +
  ggtitle("Prophet Forecast for Cash Withdrawals in May 2010") +
  theme_minimal()
```

The forecast plot shows the predicted cash withdrawals for May 2010 generated by the Prophet model. The plot allows stakeholders to visualize the forecasted values and understand the patterns and trends in the predicted cash withdrawals for each day in May 2010.

The visualization provides a clear overview of the forecasted cash withdrawals, highlighting the expected values and the uncertainty around the predictions. Stakeholders can use this visualization to make informed decisions based on the forecasted cash withdrawals for May 2010.

## **Save Forecast to Excel-Readable File**

I will now save the forecasts generated by the Prophet model for cash withdrawals in May 2010 to an Excel-readable file. This will allow me to share the forecasted values with stakeholders and use them for further analysis or reporting.

### **End of Part A**


## **Part B – Forecasting Power, ResidentialCustomerForecastLoad-624.xlsx**

**Part B consists of a simple dataset of residential power usage for January 1998 until December 2013. Your assignment is to model these data and a monthly forecast for 2014. The data is given in a single file. The variable ‘KWH’ is power consumption in Kilowatt hours, the rest is straight forward. Add this to your existing files above.**

## **Introduction**

In this part of the project, I will forecast the residential power usage for January 1998 to December 2013 and generate a monthly forecast for 2014. The dataset consists of residential power usage data, with the 'KWH' variable representing power consumption in Kilowatt hours. 

I will model the data and generate a forecast for 2014 using time series forecasting techniques. 

I will perform data exploration, data preparation, and model building to predict the residential power usage for 2014. 

I will compare the performance of different time series forecasting models and select the best model for forecasting the residential power usage. 

Finally, I will visualize the forecasts generated by the selected model and save the forecasted values to an Excel-readable file for further analysis and reporting.

## **Project Outline**

1. Load and Explore Data: Load the residential power usage data and explore its structure and contents.

2. Data Preparation: Prepare the data for time series forecasting by converting the date column to the correct format and checking for missing values.

3. Time Series Analysis: Analyze the power consumption data to understand its distribution, trends, and seasonality.

4. Time Series Decomposition: Decompose the time series data to identify the trend, seasonality, and residual components.

5. Correlation Analysis: Perform a correlation analysis to identify any relationships between the power consumption and the date.

6. Build and Evaluate Time Series Forecasting Models: Build and evaluate different time series forecasting models, including ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Prophet.

7. Forecast Visualization: Visualize the forecasts generated by the selected model to compare the predicted power consumption for 2014 with the actual values.

8. Conclusion: Summarize the findings and select the best model for forecasting the residential power usage.

9. Forecast Output: Save the forecasts generated by the selected model to an Excel-readable file for further analysis and reporting.

## **Data Exploration**

I will start by loading the residential power usage data and exploring its structure and contents. The dataset consists of residential power usage data, with the 'KWH' variable representing power consumption in Kilowatt hours.

I will load the data and check the first few rows to understand the variables and their values.

```{r}
# Load the residential power usage data
power <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enidroman/Data-624-Predictive-Analytics/refs/heads/main/ResidentialCustomerForecastLoad-624.csv")
head(power) # Display the first few rows of the data

```

The dataset contains the following variables:

CaseSequence: A unique identifier for each case or record.
YYYY.MMM: The date in "Year.Month" format (e.g., 2014.Jan).
KWH: Power usage in Kilowatt hours.

The 'KWH' variable represents the power consumption in Kilowatt hours, which is the target variable for forecasting. The 'YYYY.MMM' variable likely represents the date in "Year.Month" format, which will be crucial for time series analysis and forecasting.

### Data Types and Summary

I will check the data types of the variables in the dataset and generate a summary to understand the distribution and range of the data.

```{r}
# Check the data types of the variables
summary(power) # Generate a summary of the data
str(power)
```

The summary of the data provides insights into the distribution and range of the variables in the dataset. 

The str function provides information about the data types of the variables, which will be useful for data preparation and modeling.

CaseSequence:

This variable likely represents the sequential order of cases or records.
Range: 733 to 924
Mean: 828.5
Median: 828.5
This variable is continuous and evenly distributed across the dataset, with no missing values.
Date type is integer.

YYYY.MMM:

This is a character variable, likely representing the date in "Year.Month" format (e.g., 2014.Jan).
Since it’s a character variable, it hasn't been automatically converted to a date format. If this variable is crucial for time series forecasting, it should be converted to an appropriate date format (e.g., as.Date() in R).

This variable contains 192 unique values, indicating monthly data from January 1998 to December 2013.

KWH:

This variable represents power usage in kilowatt-hours.
Range: 770,523 to 10,655,730 KWH
Mean: 6,502,475 KWH
Median: 6,283,324 KWH
Missing Values: There is 1 missing value (NA).
The spread between the minimum and maximum values indicates significant variation in monthly power usage, which might reflect seasonal or other temporal trends.
Data type is integer.

Missing Data: There is one missing value in KWH, which may need to be imputed or handled, especially if it falls within the training period.

Temporal Patterns: Given the wide range in KWH, it's likely that this data has seasonal patterns, which would be relevant for forecasting models.

Next Steps:

Handle Missing Values: Use imputation methods like mean, median, or nearest-neighbor, or simply interpolate to fill in the missing KWH value.

Convert YYYY.MMM to Date Format: Convert the YYYY.MMM column to a date format for proper time series analysis.

Explore Seasonality: Plot KWH over time to visualize any seasonal trends, which can help in model selection for forecasting.


### Address the Columns Proper Name

I will rename the columns to more descriptive names to improve readability and clarity. This will help me identify the variables easily and understand their meanings during data analysis and modeling.


```{r}
# Rename the columns to more descriptive names
colnames(power) <- c("CaseSequence", "Date", "KWH")
head(power) # Display the first few rows of the data after renaming the columns

```

The columns have been renamed to more descriptive names, which will help in identifying the variables and understanding their meanings during data analysis and modeling.

### Date Range and Frequency

I will check the date range and frequency of the data to understand the time period covered by the dataset and the frequency of observations.

```{r}
# Check the range of dates
range(power$DATE, na.rm = TRUE)
```
This indicates that there is likely an issue with the DATE column in the power dataset. This usually happens if the DATE column is not in a valid date format, which prevents range() from calculating the actual minimum and maximum dates. As per the summary the data is in character format and not in date format.

To address this issue, I will convert the DATE column to a proper date format and then check the range of dates again.

## **Data Preparation**

I will prepare the data for time series forecasting by converting the date column to the correct format and checking for missing values. This will ensure that the data is ready for analysis and modeling.

### Convert Date Column

I will convert the 'DATE' column to a proper date format to enable time series analysis and forecasting. This will allow me to analyze the data based on the date and identify any temporal patterns in the power consumption data.

```{r}
# Convert DATE column from "YYYY-MMM" format to Date format
power$Date <- as.Date(paste0(power$Date, "-01"), format = "%Y-%b-%d")
head(power) # Check the first few rows of the data after conversion
```

The 'DATE' column has been successfully converted to a proper date format using the as.Date() function. This will enable time series analysis and forecasting based on the date variable.


```{r}
# Verify the DATE column is now in Date format
str(power$Date)

# Check the range of dates
range(power$Date, na.rm = TRUE)
```

The 'DATE' column is now in Date format, allowing for proper time series analysis and forecasting.

The range of dates indicates that the dataset covers the period from January 1998 to December 2013.

### Data Frequency

I will check the frequency of observations in the dataset to understand the time intervals between each data point. This will help me determine the temporal resolution of the data and identify any patterns in the frequency of observations.

```{r}
# Check the frequency of observations in the dataset
frequency <- diff(power$Date)
unique(frequency)
```

The frequency of observations in the dataset is 31 days, indicating that the data is recorded on a monthly basis. This monthly frequency will be important for time series analysis and forecasting, as it defines the temporal resolution of the data.

### Check for Missing Values

I will check for missing values in the dataset to ensure that the data is complete and ready for analysis. Missing values can affect the accuracy of the forecasts and may need to be handled appropriately.

```{r}
# Check for missing values in the dataset
sum(is.na(power))
```

There is one missing value in the 'KWH' variable in the dataset. I will address this missing value by imputing it using an appropriate method, such as mean, median, or interpolation.

### Impute Missing Values

I will impute the missing value in the 'KWH' variable using the mean value of the column. Imputing missing values ensures that the dataset is complete and ready for time series analysis and forecasting.


```{r}
# Impute missing values in the 'KWH' variable with the mean value
power$KWH[is.na(power$KWH)] <- mean(power$KWH, na.rm = TRUE)
# Verify that missing values have been imputed
sum(is.na(power))
```

The missing value in the 'KWH' variable has been successfully imputed using the mean value of the column. The dataset is now complete and ready for time series analysis and forecasting. 


### Check for outliers

I will check for outliers in the 'KWH' variable to identify any extreme values that may affect the analysis and modeling. Outliers can impact the accuracy of the forecasts and may need to be addressed to ensure reliable predictions.

```{r}
# Check for outliers in the 'KWH' variable
boxplot(power$KWH, main = "Boxplot of Power Consumption (KWH)")
```

The boxplot of the 'KWH' variable shows the distribution of power consumption values. Outliers are data points that fall outside the whiskers of the boxplot and may represent extreme values in the dataset.

A small circle below the lower whisker suggests a lower outlier in the data. This could represent an unusually low month of power consumption.
There appear to be no upper outliers, as the upper whisker extends to the maximum without any points beyond it.

The presence of outliers may impact the accuracy of the forecasts, especially if they are not representative of the typical data patterns. Outliers can be addressed by removing them, transforming the data, or using robust forecasting models that are less sensitive to extreme values.

Check the context of the low outlier to see if it represents a data entry error, an unusual event, or an expected seasonal dip.

If the outlier significantly impacts model performance, consider handling it (e.g., through imputation or exclusion, if appropriate).


To identify the exact location of the outlier(s) in your KWH data, you can use several approaches in R to locate values that fall outside the typical range. Since a boxplot defines outliers as any values below the lower bound or above the upper bound (based on the interquartile range), here’s how to calculate these bounds and find outliers.

### Calculate Outlier Boundaries
For a boxplot, outliers are typically defined as values that fall below Q1 - 1.5 * IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 * IQR. 

I will calculate the quartiles and interquartile range (IQR) for the 'KWH' variable and determine the lower and upper bounds for outliers based on these values.


```{r}
# Calculate quartiles and IQR for KWH
Q1 <- quantile(power$KWH, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)
Q3 <- quantile(power$KWH, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)
IQR <- Q3 - Q1

# Calculate the lower and upper bounds for outliers
lower_bound <- Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_bound <- Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

lower_bound
upper_bound
```

The lower bound for outliers is approximately 2,000,000 KWH, while the upper bound is around 10,000,000 KWH. Any values below the lower bound or above the upper bound can be considered outliers based on the boxplot definition.

### Identify Outliers

With these boundaries, you can filter the dataset to find values that fall outside them.


```{r}
# Identify outliers in the KWH variable
# Filter rows where KWH is an outlier
outliers <- power %>% 
  filter(KWH < lower_bound | KWH > upper_bound)

# View the rows with outliers
outliers
```

The outliers in the 'KWH' variable have been identified based on the lower and upper bounds calculated from the quartiles and IQR. These outliers represent extreme values in the dataset that fall outside the typical range of power consumption.

The presence of outliers may impact the accuracy of the forecasts, especially if they are not representative of the typical data patterns. Outliers can be addressed by removing them, transforming the data, or using robust forecasting models that are less sensitive to extreme values.

Check the context of the outliers to determine if they represent data entry errors, unusual events, or expected seasonal variations. Depending on the nature of the outliers, you can decide on an appropriate approach to handle them in the analysis and modeling process.

### Remove Outliers

I will remove the identified outliers from the dataset to ensure that the data is clean and ready for time series analysis and forecasting. Removing outliers can help improve the accuracy of the forecasts by eliminating extreme values that may distort the patterns in the data.

```{r}
# Remove outliers from the dataset
power_clean <- power %>% 
  filter(KWH >= lower_bound & KWH <= upper_bound)
```


I will check to see if outlier has been removed.


```{r}
# Check the dimensions of the cleaned dataset
dim(power_clean)
```

The outliers have been successfully removed from the dataset, resulting in a cleaned dataset with 192 observations. The cleaned dataset is now ready for time series analysis and forecasting.

### Check if date is in chronological order

I will check if the 'Date' column is in chronological order to ensure that the data is correctly sequenced for time series analysis and forecasting.


```{r}
# Check if the 'Date' column is in chronological order
is_sorted <- all(diff(power_clean$Date) > 0)
is_sorted
```

The 'Date' column is in chronological order, as indicated by the TRUE value. This ensures that the data is correctly sequenced for time series analysis and forecasting.

## **Time Series Analysis and Forcasting**

I will perform time series analysis on the residential power usage data to understand its distribution, trends, and seasonality. Time series analysis will help me identify patterns in the data and select appropriate forecasting models for predicting future power consumption.

### Visualize Power Consumption Over Time

I will plot the power consumption data over time to visualize the trends and patterns in the residential power usage. This will help me identify any seasonal variations, trends, or irregularities in the data.

```{r}
# Visualize power consumption over time
ggplot(power_clean, aes(x = Date, y = KWH)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Residential Power Consumption Over Time", x = "Date", y = "Power Consumption (KWH)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

The line plot shows the residential power consumption over time, with the 'KWH' variable on the y-axis and the 'Date' variable on the x-axis. The plot visualizes the trends and patterns in the power consumption data, allowing me to identify any seasonal variations, trends, or irregularities.

Trend:

There is an upward trend over the years, with power consumption generally increasing from 1998 to around 2013. This suggests growing demand for residential power, which could be due to factors such as population growth, increased appliance usage, or rising comfort standards.
Seasonality:

There is a clear seasonal pattern, as seen in the regular peaks and troughs each year. This seasonality is likely driven by seasonal weather changes—higher usage in colder winter months for heating and in summer months for cooling.
Variability Over Time:

The peaks and troughs seem to increase in amplitude over time, which suggests increasing variability in power consumption. This could indicate that the range of consumption between seasons has become more pronounced in recent years.
Anomalies:

There are no obvious, large anomalies (outliers) that stand out from the seasonal pattern, indicating consistent behavior over the observed period.

The time series plot provides valuable insights into the trends, seasonality, and patterns in the residential power consumption data, which will inform the selection of appropriate forecasting models.

## **Time Series Decomposition**

I will decompose the time series data to identify the trend, seasonality, and residual components. Time series decomposition helps in understanding the underlying patterns in the data and selecting appropriate models for forecasting.

To separate the trend, seasonality, and residual components, you can use time series decomposition. This will give you a clearer picture of each component individually.


```{r}
# Decompose the time series data
power_decomp <- decompose(ts(power_clean$KWH, frequency = 12)) # Monthly frequency
power_decomp
```


### Visualization of Decomposed Time Series

I will visualize the decomposed time series components to understand the trend, seasonality, and residual patterns in the residential power consumption data. This will help me identify the underlying patterns and select appropriate models for forecasting.


```{r}
# Visualize the decomposed time series components

# Plot the original time series data
original_plot <- ggplot(power_clean, aes(x = Date, y = KWH)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Original Time Series Data", x = "Date", y = "Power Consumption (KWH)") +
  theme_minimal()

# Plot the trend component
trend_plot <- ggplot() +
  geom_line(data = data.frame(Date = power_clean$Date, Trend = power_decomp$trend), aes(x = Date, y = Trend), color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Trend Component of Time Series Data", x = "Date", y = "Trend") +
  theme_minimal()

# Plot the seasonal component
seasonal_plot <- ggplot() +
  geom_line(data = data.frame(Date = power_clean$Date, Seasonal = power_decomp$seasonal), aes(x = Date, y = Seasonal), color = "green") +
  labs(title = "Seasonal Component of Time Series Data", x = "Date", y = "Seasonal") +
  theme_minimal()

# Plot the residual component

residual_plot <- ggplot() +
  geom_line(data = data.frame(Date = power_clean$Date, Residual = power_decomp$random), aes(x = Date, y = Residual), color = "purple") +
  labs(title = "Residual Component of Time Series Data", x = "Date", y = "Residual") +
  theme_minimal()

# Combine the plots

gridExtra::grid.arrange(original_plot, trend_plot, seasonal_plot, residual_plot, nrow = 4)
```


The time series decomposition provides insights into the trend, seasonality, and residual components of the residential power consumption data. These components can help in understanding the underlying patterns in the data and selecting appropriate models for forecasting.

Original Time Series Data:

This is the raw power consumption data (KWH) over time. As seen in the plot, there’s a visible seasonal pattern with regular peaks and troughs, and an overall slight upward trend.
Trend Component:

The trend line shows the gradual change in power consumption over the years. Here, it appears relatively stable with a slight upward movement around 2005-2010, indicating a gradual increase in overall consumption.
Seasonal Component:

This captures the recurring monthly patterns. The seasonal component shows that power consumption likely spikes and dips at regular intervals within each year, possibly corresponding to summer and winter demands (e.g., for cooling and heating).
Residual Component:

The residuals represent the remaining fluctuations after removing trend and seasonality, capturing any irregular variations. Here, the residuals appear relatively stable, though there are some minor spikes that could indicate anomalies or unexpected variations.

Trend and Seasonality: Since you have both a trend and clear seasonality, this dataset is well-suited for a seasonal forecasting model such as Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) or ETS.
Residual Stability: The stability in residuals suggests the model has captured most of the predictable patterns, which is ideal for accurate forecasting.

The decomposition analysis provides valuable insights into the trend, seasonality, and residual components of the residential power consumption data, which will inform the selection of appropriate forecasting models.


### **Correlation Analysis**

I will perform a correlation analysis to identify any relationships between the power consumption and the date. Correlation analysis helps in understanding the associations between variables and can provide insights into the patterns in the data.

I will calculate the correlation coefficient between the 'KWH' variable (power consumption) and the 'Date' variable to determine if there is any relationship between the two variables.


```{r}
# Calculate the correlation coefficient between KWH and Date
correlation <- cor(power_clean$KWH, as.numeric(power_clean$Date))
correlation

```
The correlation coefficient between KWH (power consumption) and Date is approximately 0.30.

Positive Correlation: 

A positive correlation coefficient indicates a positive relationship between the two variables. In this case, the correlation suggests that as time progresses, there is a slight tendency for power consumption to increase.

Implications for Trend:

This weak correlation supports the observation in the decomposition plot, where we saw a slight upward trend in the KWH data over the years. However, other factors (such as seasonality and possibly external influences) likely have a stronger impact on KWH than time alone.
Modeling Consideration:

Since the correlation is not very strong, simply using time as a predictor in a linear model might not capture the full complexity of the data. A time series model that considers seasonality and trend components (like ARIMA, ETS, or Prophet) will likely provide a more accurate forecast for power consumption.


## **Build and Evaluate Time Series Forecasting Models**

I will build and evaluate different time series forecasting models to predict the residential power usage for 2014. I will consider ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Prophet models for forecasting and compare their performance based on accuracy metrics.

I will split the data into training and testing sets, build the forecasting models using the training data, and evaluate the models using the testing data. I will then compare the accuracy of the models to select the best model for forecasting the residential power usage.

### Split Data into Training and Testing Sets

The training set will be used to train the models, while the testing set will be used to evaluate the models' performance.

I will split the data into a training set (January 1998 to December 2012) and a testing set (January 2013 to December 2013) to build and evaluate the forecasting models.


```{r}
# Split the data into training and testing sets
train <- power_clean %>% filter(Date < "2013-01-01")
test <- power_clean %>% filter(Date >= "2013-01-01")

# Check the dimensions of the training and testing sets
dim(train)

dim(test)
```

The data has been successfully split into a training set with 180 observations (January 1998 to December 2012) and a testing set with 12 observations (January 2013 to December 2013). The training set will be used to train the forecasting models, while the testing set will be used to evaluate the models' performance.


### ARIMA Model

I will build an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model to forecast the residential power usage for 2014. ARIMA is a popular time series forecasting model that captures trend, seasonality, and noise in the data.

I will fit an ARIMA model to the training data and generate forecasts for the testing period. I will evaluate the model's performance using accuracy metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

```{r}
# Fit ARIMA model to the training data
arima_model <- auto.arima(train$KWH)

# Generate forecasts for the testing period
arima_forecast <- forecast(arima_model, h = nrow(test))

# Evaluate the ARIMA model
arima_accuracy <- accuracy(arima_forecast, test$KWH)

# Display the accuracy metrics
arima_accuracy
```

The ARIMA model has been fitted to the training data, and forecasts have been generated for the testing period. The accuracy metrics provide insights into the performance of the ARIMA model in forecasting the residential power usage for 2014.

Mean Error (ME): -19,942.63

This is the average error across all predictions in the training set. A negative value here suggests a slight underestimation, but it is relatively small compared to the RMSE.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 863,789

This measures the average magnitude of the errors, giving more weight to larger errors. This value is large, suggesting some variability in the accuracy of the predictions, although this alone doesn’t indicate bias in a particular direction.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 689,780.5

This shows the average absolute errors, representing the average difference between predicted and actual values in straightforward terms. It is slightly lower than the RMSE, indicating that while errors are generally high, they’re consistent.
Mean Percentage Error (MPE): -2.16%

The MPE is slightly negative, suggesting that the model underestimates on average, but this bias is small.
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): 11.12%

MAPE is the average percentage error, which is relatively low. This means the model’s predictions are, on average, within 11.12% of the actual values, a decent accuracy level for time series with large values.
Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE): 0.62

A MASE below 1 typically indicates that the model performs better than a naive forecast (such as the last value carried forward), suggesting the model adds value in the training set.
Autocorrelation of Residuals (ACF1): -0.11

ACF1 measures the correlation between residuals and lagged residuals. A value close to zero would indicate that there is little autocorrelation remaining, suggesting the model has adequately captured the data structure. Here, it’s slightly negative, implying no major autocorrelation.
Test Set Metrics
ME: 275,763.63

A positive value suggests slight overestimation in the test set, a shift from the training set’s slight underestimation.
RMSE: 1,446,065

The RMSE is much higher for the test set than the training set, which suggests the model does not generalize as well to unseen data and indicates potential overfitting.
MAE: 1,261,659.3

Similar to RMSE, the MAE is also higher, reinforcing the idea of reduced accuracy on the test data.
MPE: 0.05%

The MPE is very close to zero, suggesting minimal average bias in prediction direction.
MAPE: 16.36%

The MAPE is higher than in the training set, indicating that, on average, test set predictions are less accurate, falling within 16.36% of actual values.
MASE: 1.14

A MASE greater than 1 on the test set suggests that the model performs worse than a naive forecast on unseen data, reinforcing the overfitting suggestion.

Training vs. Test Set Performance: The model performs reasonably well on the training set but shows significantly reduced accuracy on the test set, indicating potential overfitting. This means that while the model has learned patterns in the training data, it struggles to generalize these patterns to new data.

### Visualization of ARIMA Forecast

I will visualize the forecasts generated by the ARIMA model to compare the predicted power consumption for 2014 with the actual values. This will help me evaluate the performance of the ARIMA model visually and understand how well it captures the trends and patterns in the data.

```{r}
# Visualize ARIMA forecast
arima_plot <- autoplot(arima_forecast) +
  labs(title = "ARIMA Forecast for Residential Power Usage in 2014", x = "Date", y = "Power Consumption (KWH)") +
  theme_minimal()

arima_plot
```

The forecast plot shows the predicted power consumption for 2014 generated by the ARIMA model. The plot visualizes the forecasted values along with the confidence intervals, allowing me to compare the forecasts with the actual values and evaluate the performance of the ARIMA model.

Seasonality and Trend:

The forecast captures the seasonality well, with repeated peaks and troughs that resemble the historical pattern seen in past years.
There appears to be an upward trend in power consumption over time, which is consistent with the trend observed in the original time series data.
Forecast Range:

The shaded areas in the plot represent the confidence intervals (likely at 80% and 95%) around the forecasted values. The forecasted values are within a reasonable range, but the intervals widen as we move further into the forecast period.
This widening indicates increased uncertainty, which is typical in time series forecasting. This is especially important when forecasting for a full year, as the model becomes less confident in its exact predictions over time.
Short-Term Stability:

The forecast for the beginning of 2014 remains closely aligned with the patterns observed in 2013. The model captures the anticipated fluctuations within each month, predicting higher power consumption in certain months (e.g., likely summer and winter peaks due to heating and cooling demands) and lower consumption in milder months.
Possible Anomalies:

There might be a few outlier points in the historical data (based on the residuals from earlier decomposition) which may affect the model's confidence in forecasting. It's good to note if these outliers align with extreme weather events or other factors, as they may need to be factored into model refinement or adjustments.
Model Accuracy:

Without the full model accuracy metrics here, it’s challenging to declare the model’s effectiveness, but the ARIMA model seems to capture seasonal and trend components well.
From the accuracy metrics you shared previously (MAE, RMSE, etc.), we can infer that there is some error in the forecast, as the model struggles with capturing the extreme peaks accurately. This is common in time series forecasting, where the model may not perfectly predict unusual events or extreme values.

The ARIMA model does a good job of capturing the seasonal and trend patterns in residential power consumption. The forecasted values for 2014 align well with historical seasonal patterns, though confidence intervals suggest increased uncertainty over time. Adding more explanatory variables or combining ARIMA with other models could potentially improve the forecast's accuracy, especially if further reduction in error is required.


### Exponential Smoothing Model

I will build an Exponential Smoothing model to forecast the residential power usage for 2014. Exponential Smoothing is a time series forecasting method that assigns exponentially decreasing weights to past observations.

I will fit an Exponential Smoothing model to the training data and generate forecasts for the testing period. I will evaluate the model's performance using accuracy metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).


```{r}
# Fit Exponential Smoothing model to the training data
ets_model <- ets(train$KWH)

# Generate forecasts for the testing period
ets_forecast <- forecast(ets_model, h = nrow(test))

# Evaluate the Exponential Smoothing model

ets_accuracy <- accuracy(ets_forecast, test$KWH)

# Display the accuracy metrics

ets_accuracy
```

Metrics Analysis
Mean Error (ME):

The training set shows a mean error of 74,219.25, while the test set has a higher mean error of 573,440.04.
Positive mean error on the test set suggests the model might be consistently underestimating power consumption.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):

RMSE for the training set is 1,323,279, and for the test set, it’s 1,665,972.
RMSE values are quite high, indicating significant deviations between the forecasted and actual values, particularly in the test set. This suggests the model struggles with accurately capturing the peaks and troughs in power consumption, especially out-of-sample.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE):

MAE values are 1,133,456 for the training set and 1,428,886 for the test set.
MAE is generally lower than RMSE, which is expected. However, a high MAE in both sets shows that on average, the model's forecasts are off by a large margin in absolute terms, highlighting a need for potential improvements.
Mean Percentage Error (MPE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):

MPE for the training set is -2.97% (suggesting a slight under-forecasting tendency), while for the test set, it is 3.64%.
MAPE values are around 17.93% for the training set and 18.06% for the test set, indicating that the average forecast error is around 18% of the actual values. While MAPE below 20% can be acceptable in some contexts, it may still be high for a model aimed at precise power consumption forecasting.
Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE):

The training set has a MASE of 1.02, and the test set is at 1.29.
A MASE of 1.0 or above indicates that the model's forecasting errors are as large as or larger than a naïve seasonal model. Since the test set MASE is higher than 1, this suggests the model does not consistently outperform a simple seasonal benchmark.
Autocorrelation of Residuals (ACF1):

The ACF1 for the training set is 0.47, indicating that there is moderate autocorrelation in the residuals.
A non-zero autocorrelation means the model may not have fully captured all patterns in the data, leaving some structure in the residuals. This could point to possible improvements by adjusting the model parameters or exploring additional seasonal patterns.

The model's performance has room for improvement, especially in handling the variability seen in the test set. Key findings include:

High RMSE and MAE: The model has significant forecasting errors, with substantial deviations from actual values, especially out-of-sample.

MAPE in the Acceptable Range: The MAPE is around 18%, which might be tolerable in certain business scenarios but suggests that the model could still be improved for better accuracy.

Residual Autocorrelation: The ACF1 value suggests that the model hasn't fully explained the time series structure, indicating that it may benefit from adjustments or additional modeling techniques.


### Visualization of Exponential Smoothing Forecast

I will visualize the forecasts generated by the Exponential Smoothing model to compare the predicted power consumption for 2014 with the actual values. This will help me evaluate the performance of the Exponential Smoothing model visually and understand how well it captures the trends and patterns in the data.

```{r}
# Visualize Exponential Smoothing forecast
ets_plot <- autoplot(ets_forecast) +
  labs(title = "Exponential Smoothing Forecast for Residential Power Usage in 2014", x = "Date", y = "Power Consumption (KWH)") +
  theme_minimal()

ets_plot
```

Forecast Visualization:

The plot shows the predicted power consumption for 2014 in a blue line with confidence intervals shaded in light blue.
The forecast captures the regular seasonal pattern present in the historical data, indicating that the exponential smoothing model has adapted to the seasonal cycle in power usage.
Seasonal Pattern:

The historical data shows a clear seasonal trend, with power consumption peaking and dipping consistently throughout each year.
Exponential smoothing, which is well-suited for data with seasonal patterns, follows this cycle in its predictions, suggesting it has captured this aspect accurately.
Confidence Intervals:

The confidence intervals widen slightly over the forecast horizon, which is typical in exponential smoothing as the model incorporates uncertainty into future periods.
This shows that while the model is confident in its short-term predictions, it accounts for more variability further into the future.
Comparison with Actual Data (if available):

Ideally, comparing the forecasted values with actual 2014 data would allow for a more precise assessment of the model's accuracy.
If available, metrics like RMSE and MAPE should be used to quantify forecast performance, as done with ARIMA, to determine if exponential smoothing provides a better fit.
Model Strengths and Limitations:

Strengths: Exponential smoothing is efficient for data with strong seasonality and trends, as it smooths past values and projects future trends based on recent patterns.
Limitations: While good at short-term forecasts, it may struggle with long-term predictions or abrupt shifts in power consumption that deviate from historical patterns.

Exponential smoothing appears to be a reasonable model given the seasonal characteristics of the power consumption data. 

### Prophet Model

I will build a Prophet model to forecast the residential power usage for 2014. Prophet is a time series forecasting model developed by Facebook that is designed to handle seasonality, holidays, and outliers in the data.

I will fit a Prophet model to the training data and generate forecasts for the testing period. I will evaluate the model's performance using accuracy metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

```{r}
# Prepare the data for Prophet by renaming columns
prophet_data <- train %>%
  select(ds = Date, y = KWH)

Mean Error (ME): -1,000,000

This is the average error across all predictions in the training set. A negative value here suggests a slight underestimation, but it is relatively small compared to the RMSE.

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 941,447.4

This measures the average magnitude of the errors, giving more weight to larger errors. This value is large, suggesting some variability in the accuracy of the predictions, although this alone doesn’t indicate bias in a particular direction.

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 662,691

This shows the average absolute errors, representing the average difference between predicted and actual values in straightforward terms. It is slightly lower than the RMSE, indicating that while errors are generally high, they’re consistent.

Mean Percentage Error (MPE): -0.03%

The MPE is slightly negative, suggesting that the model underestimates on average, but this bias is small.

Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): 8.13%

MAPE is the average percentage error, which is relatively low. This means the model’s predictions are, on average, within 8.13% of the actual values, a decent accuracy level for time series with large values.
